                        <p>Civic Future will open up public life by identifying and educating talented young people in early or mid-career, as well as established leaders in the public, private and social sectors. We will equip them with the tools to navigate the arcane and often intimidating world of the British political system, providing intellectual insight and practical training.</p>
                        <p>We will establish a new talent pipeline to attract brilliant and inspirational participants from different backgrounds, and support them to become the public leaders we deserve.</p>

                        <p>We have launched the Civic Future Fellowship, a one-year programme for early to mid-career individuals that equips them with the knowledge, skills, and support to become great public leaders.</p>
                        <p>The Fellowship programme is a unique year-long programme which has been designed to be conducted alongside a full-time job, and is offered complete free. Spanning three carefully structured terms of ten weeks each, the programme convenes for discussion on a weekday evening in central London from October to July.</p>

                <h1>Who we are looking for</h1>
                <p>Our ideal Fellow is in early-mid career. You may already be working in politics or public life, or aspire to pursue a public role after the end of the programme. If you’re a highly driven individual who desires to break Britain out of stagnation, then apply. It is easy to do so and the potential upside for you – and the country – is very high.</p>
                
                <p>We can also arrange full-time, paid, London-based professional work placements in relevant organisations for a select number of applicants.</p>
                <p>At the end of the Fellowship, participants will take part in career sessions offering insights about public service opportunities, and be paired up with a senior mentor already working in public life.</p>
